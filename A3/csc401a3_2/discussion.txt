2.3 Experiments and discussion

Experiments results:

M -- S -- e -- accuracy
8    30   0.5  100%
4    30   0.5  93.33%
8    10   0.5  46.667%
8    30   10   86.67%

From this table we find the accuracy increase as M, S increase, eplison decreases.

a) How might you improve the classification accuracy of the Gaussian mixtures, without adding more training data?

The non-ideal cov matrix should be included.

b) When would your classifier decide that a given test utterance comes from none of the trained speaker models, and how would your classifier come to this decision?

Given the sample size and training size, we can make null hypothesis and calculate our confidence interval based on that.

c) Can you think of some alternative methods for doing speaker identification that donâ€™t use Gaussian mixtures?

Convolutional neural network.

3.2 Experiment and discussion:

I trained the whole set of data and it took me a whole night. The overall accurate is 38.34%. To save sometime, I only trained 1K or 500 rows per phoneme, and get the following results.

M -- D -- Q -- T -- Accuracy
8    14   3    5H   26.34%
8    14   3    1K   28.43%
8    14   2    5H   24.21%
8    14   2    1K   25.32%
8    8    3    5H   22.32%
8    8    3    1K   23.76%
8    8    2    5H   21.88%
8    8    2    1K   23.33%
4    14   3    5H   19.23%
4    14   3    1K   20.45%
4    14   2    5H   18.34%
4    14   2    1K   18.99%
4    8    3    5H   16.43%
4    8    3    1K   17.88%
4    8    2    5H   16.03%
4    8    2    1K   18.44%

From the table, I can tell as M, D, Q and T increase, the accuracy increase. This makes sense because we are providing more rich data, more states and more mixtures per state. 

Interstingly, M and D increase will lead to larger increase than Q and T.
